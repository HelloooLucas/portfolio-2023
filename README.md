# portfolio 2023

Welcome to my first ever dev portfolio! ðŸŽ‰

### Motivation
This project came to life to serve two purposes: have a place to show some of the freelance work I'm doing, and challenge me to use an almost bare-metal stack.
On my everyday job I'm using packages and frameworks that provide numerous abstractions from the native web APIs, so I wanted to see if I could do something good-looking with just HTML, CSS and Javascript (TS actually).
Also, I've been an avid watcher of creative websites such as those displayed on Awwwards, FWA and others, and I wanted to see if I could reproduce some of the nice animations and transition I'm seeing everyday.

### Tools I used
- Figma for design
- HTML
- SCSS
- Typescript
- GSAP
